# Lower-Level-Asteroid-Game-Enging-With-Python
Algorithm based Asteroid-Rock game using Pygame and Numpy on Python



🎮 Gameplay
Control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen

Rocks fall from random positions at the top

Avoid collisions for as long as possible

When a collision occurs:

The game ends

Final survival time is displayed for 3 seconds

The window then closes automatically

🕹️ Controls
Key	Action

A	Move left

D	Move right

ESC / Close Window	Quit game


🧠 Game Logic Overview

Rock spawning uses a timer (pygame.time.get_ticks)

Movement & physics are frame-rate independent

Collision detection uses pygame.Rect.colliderect()

Score is calculated from survival time (seconds alive)

Game-over state keeps the window open for 3 seconds to display final score
